# How I used CoPilot:

### Building and Enhancing CRUD Endpoints:

Designed basic CRUD operations for managing users with ASP.NET Core Minimal API.

Added features like search functionality to filter users by Name or Email.

### Thread-Safety Improvements:

Replaced the regular dictionary with ConcurrentDictionary for thread-safe operations.

Used Interlocked.Increment to safely generate unique user IDs in concurrent environments.

### Validation:

Implemented robust user input validation for required fields like Name and Email.

Added email format validation to ensure proper input data handling.

### Token-Based Authentication:

Helped create a middleware to validate JWT tokens for securing API endpoints.

Designed a reusable JwtTokenGenerator class to generate tokens with claims.

### Organizing Middlewares:

Structured middlewares into their own folder (Middleware) and updated namespaces and Program.cs for clean, maintainable code.

### Error Handling:

Implemented custom middleware for handling unhandled exceptions with consistent JSON error responses.

Extended error responses to include metadata like request IDs and timestamps for better debugging.

Performance Optimization:

Suggested improvements such as caching, reducing redundant middleware operations, minimizing data payloads, and optimizing token validation.

### Reusable HTTP Tests:

Created an HTTP test file to easily test the API endpoints in tools like Postman or REST Client.

### Code Refactoring:

Advised on organizing the project structure for clarity and scalability.

Provided feedback on logging, asynchronous patterns, and profiling techniques for better performance.

###Secret Management:

Helped generate a 256-bit secure secret key for signing JWT tokens.

Explained proper handling and storage of secret keys.

This project evolved into a robust and secure API with a clean structure, better performance, and strong authentication mechanisms.
